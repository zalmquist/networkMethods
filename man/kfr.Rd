\description{
David Krackhardt collected cognitive social structure data
from 21 management personnel in a high-tech, machine manufacturing
firm to assess the effects of a recent management intervention program.
The relation queried was â€œWho is a friend of X?" (krackfr). Each person indicated
not only his or her own advice and friendship relationships, but also
the relations he or she perceived among all other managers, generating a
full 21 by 21 matrix of adjacency ratings from each person in the group.
